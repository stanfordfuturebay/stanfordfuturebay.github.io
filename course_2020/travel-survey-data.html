<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.1</span> Travel survey data</h2>
<p>While the ACS includes some measures of mobility, like commute mode and commute travel time, this represents a far end of a spectrum of mobility insights we might be able to use for urban data analytics. On the other end would be something like cell phone device data, providing nearly raw information about the movement behavior of individuals, but needing a significant amount of processing to convert to interpretable insights, and presenting privacy concerns. Somewhere in the middle is mobility data in the form of travel diaries, where a large sample of respondents is asked to meticulously record information about their trips on a particular date, which, when compiled together, provide a rich statistical distribution of travel patterns and behaviors, comparable to PUMS data.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://nhts.ornl.gov/">National Household Travel Survey</a> is one such dataset that is available for analysis, and furthermore, the latest available survey from 2017 included an <a href="https://www.nrel.gov/transportation/secure-transportation-data/tsdc-nhts-california.html">add-on survey for California</a>, given the state’s size and complexity, which provides richer data for our Bay Area focus.</p>
<p>Like PUMS data, ths NHTS data has a complicated data dictionary and linkages between different datasets, but this section will help you navigate some of this data structure to get basic insights. At the second link above, download the “Full Survey Data” to somewhere on your personal machine (this will determine your own individual <code>path</code>). In the unzipped folder, the CSVs will be files we load into R in the chunk below. We’ll also load in one tab from the Excel data dictionary file, but you may find it helpful to open the Excel file and the PDF separately as references.</p>

<p><code>weights_person_7day</code> holds a field called <code>wttrdfin</code> which has a unique weight for each person, who is defined by a household ID (<code>sampno</code>) and a person ID (<code>perno</code>). Just like with PUMS, this weight is the number of times you would duplicate each individual person’s record (including all their trips) in order to best represent the entire CA population. To link this to <code>survey_person</code>, all we need to do is use a <code>left_join()</code>:</p>

<p><code>survey_trips</code> contains information about individual trips made by individual people, and this information can also be linked to person-level information using a <code>left_join()</code>. In turn, all person-level information can be linked to household-level information based on the <code>sampno</code> field. There might be many reasons all of these files need to be linked together, but for our purposes, one critical reason to link with <code>survey_households</code> at all is because it contains a field <code>hh_cbsa</code>, which is the available geography in the data we downloaded. In particular, this is a “core based statistical area”, which we can access via <code>tigris</code>. Below, we get <code>bay_counties</code> and filter to the CBSAs that contain the centroids of our Bay Area counties:</p>

<p>Notice that with the exception of some extra regions south of Santa Clara County, this set of CBSAs closely resembles Bay Area counties.</p>
<p>Now, let’s create a fully linked dataframe of all potentially useful variables across four different datasets, and filter down to just data for the Bay Area CBSAs:</p>

<p>One key conceptual choice to make is whether to assign trips based on their destination, origin, or a combination of both (this kind of choice arises when considering attribution of greenhouse gas emissions as well). We can simulate the third option by assigning counts first based on destination and origin separately, then taking the average of both.</p>
<p><code>trptrans</code> provides information about the travel mode of the trip across the following variables:</p>

<p>Note that mode attribution can get complicated when multiple modes are used in the same trip. In this survey, multimodal trips should already be divided up given that one of the trip purposes from the previous table is “Change type of transportation”. In any case, <code>trptrans</code> is formally designed to be the derived mode of travel for each trip, considering all information available.</p>
<p>Let’s process the trip dataframe, grouping by and summarizing trip counts (as well as trip miles) by the purpose and mode labels above. In the third step, we average the first two summarized tables, which have counts based on <code>purpose_label</code> but based on two separate sources, <code>why_to</code> and <code>why_from</code>.</p>

<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>y = reorder(mode_label, desc(mode_label))</code> is done because, as we’ve encountered before, <code>ggplot2</code> tends to put the y-axis in the order we’d expect for number graphs, but in this case, we’d prefer to have the order read low to high from top to bottom.</li>
<li><code>geom_tile</code> and <code>geom_text</code> are newly used here, but simulate a table. <code>geom_tile</code> provides the color background to the cells.</li>
<li>Based on trial and error, I’ve decided to divide the raw trip counts by one million (<code>1e6</code>) and <code>round()</code> the result so that the cell text is more legible. Having done this, it is then important to explain the units of the table in the subtitle of the plot.</li>
<li>While it would have been possible to shorten the axis labels in either axis, here I’m choosing to show them in full. It is therefore necessary to rotate the x-axis labels, otherwise they wouldn’t be legible at all. <code>axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)</code> happens to work well for 45 degree angle rotation. For 90 degree text, use <code>axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1)</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Now, having inspected the results, it appears that some refinements could be made:</p>
<ul>
<li>Based on our rounding, any trip counts less than <code>1e6/2</code>, or 500,000, were rounded down to 0. To simplify the plot, we could remove these values completely, rendering them <code>NA</code> just like many existing gaps in the plot. Doing this could also remove entire rows and columns from the plot.</li>
<li>Trip purposes 1 and 2 are related to home (i.e. the trip that left home or the trip that returned home). Every roundtrip, of course, involves home at the start and end. Since the focus of our analysis is on the reasons for travel that cause one to leave home, we don’t need the self-evident information captured in these columns, so they can be removed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s replot the previous information with these refinements as filters:</p>

<p>A conceptual takeaway from these tables is that work-related trips, or commute trips, are not the largest individual source of trips but are the largest individual source of trip miles. Also, of course, cars are the dominant mode of travel. These observations will inform some of our subsequent focus areas in this chapter, like commute-based travel data and car-based trip routing. Otherwise, this section has demonstrated how to begin analyzing the many rich layers of NHTS data, as well as how to create heat map tables in <code>ggplot2</code>.</p>
